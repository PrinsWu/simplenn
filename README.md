The simple Neural Network with Java for beginner.
I hope java programmer can enter neural network and learn the concept by hand not just read some sample code.

Step 1: Single Neural (Perceptron)
Start from XorNN it can lean OR, AND but Xor not work.
XorNN2 use Step be activation function, and add bias but Xor still not work.

Step 2: two neurals
XorNN3 use two neurals to lean Xor, it works.

Step 3: build a neural network framework
Use SimpleNNBuilder be a builder to setup and create a SimpleNeuralWork.
You can start with linear, the LinearNN1 try to find 0.5 be weight.

Step 4: hex
It will transform hex to decimal.

Step 5: digits
It include two example, one is seven segment display, another is dot matrix display.

Step 6: minst
It not work, too slow if calculate by each elements of array.
I suggest use Python to continue more complex topics.
